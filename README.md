# Dice Game
Dice Game is a simple probability-based game created with Lua and Solar2D. In this game, players roll a virtual dice and bet on whether the next roll will result in a higher or lower value. This game, along with the graphics, was created as a final project for my ICS3U course.

## How to Play
* Choose your bet amount by clicking the casino chips ranging from 5-20 dollar values.
* Select either the "Higher," "Lower" or “Equal” option depending on what you think the next roll will be.
* Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice.
* If your prediction is correct, you win! Otherwise, you lose your bet amount.
* After losing the game, you can view your score based on your performance.

## Installation and Setup
Below is how to set up the game on your local machine.

* Download the Solar2D game engine from the official website.
* Clone this repository to your local machine using: `git clone https://github.com/alexstarosta/diceGame`
* Open the project in Solar2D.
* Build and run the project in the Solar2D simulator or on your device.

## Customization

Dice Game comes with custom-made graphics. You can modify these assets by replacing the existing files in the `images` folder with your own. Additionally, you can adjust the bet limits and other variables by modifying the values in the `main.lua` file.
